### [0. Get all states](./0-select_states.py)

* Write a script that lists all states from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:

### [1. Filter states](./1-filter_states.py)

* Write a script that lists all states with a name starting with N (upper N) from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:

### [2. Filter states by user input](./2-my_filter_states.py)

* Write a script that takes in an argument and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument.

### [3. SQL Injection...](./3-my_safe_filter_states.py)

* Wait, do you remember the previous task? Did you test "Arizona'; TRUNCATE TABLE states ; SELECT * FROM states WHERE name = '" as an input?

### [4. Cities by states](./4-cities_by_state.py)

* Write a script that lists all cities from the database hbtn_0e_4_usa

### [5. All cities by state](./5-filter_cities.py)

* Write a script that takes in the name of a state as an argument and lists all cities of that state, using the database hbtn_0e_4_usa

### [6. First state model](./model_state.py)

* Write a python file that contains the class definition of a State and an instance Base = declarative_base():

  * State class:

    * inherits from Base Tips

    * links to the MySQL table states

    * class attribute id that represents a column of an auto-generated, unique integer, can’t be null and is a primary key

    * class attribute name that represents a column of a string with maximum 128 characters and can’t be null

### [7. All states via SQLAlchemy](./7-model_state_fetch_all.py)

* Write a script that lists all State objects from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa

### [8. First state](./8-model_state_fetch_first.py)

* Write a script that prints the first State object from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa

### [9. Contains `a`](./9-model_state_filter_a.py)

* Write a script that lists all State objects that contain the letter a from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa

### [10. Get a state](./10-model_state_my_get.py)

* Write a script that prints the State object with the name passed as argument from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa

### [11. Add a new state](./11-model_state_insert.py)

* Write a script that adds the State object “Louisiana” to the database hbtn_0e_6_usa

### [12. Update a state](./12-model_state_update_id_2.py)

* Write a script that changes the name of a State object from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa

### [13. Delete states](./13-model_state_delete_a.py)

* Write a script that deletes all State objects with a name containing the letter a from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa

### [14. Cities in state](./model_city.py)

* Write a Python file similar to model_state.py named model_city.py that contains the class definition of a City.

### [15. City relationship](./relationship_city.py)

* Improve the files model_city.py and model_state.py, and save them as relationship_city.py and relationship_state.py:

### [16. List relationship](./101-relationship_states_cities_list.py)

* Write a script that lists all State objects, and corresponding City objects, contained in the database hbtn_0e_101_usa

### [17. From city](./102-relationship_cities_states_list.py)

* Write a script that lists all City objects from the database hbtn_0e_101_usa
